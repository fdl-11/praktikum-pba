    "text = \"\"\" Saudi Arabia is seeking stronger cooperation with China on trade investments and energy flows rather than competing with the superpower, said Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. We came to recognize the reality of today that China is taking, had taken a lead, will continue to take that lead. We don’t have to compete with China, we have to collaborate with China, he told CNBC’s Dan Murphy during the Arab-China Business Conference on Sunday. He added that there is value in working with China because they have taken the lead in getting the right manufacturers especially in the renewables space. We will never go again to this zero-sum game. On why the OPEC kingpin has eyes on China, Abdulaziz said he believes that China’s oil demand is still growing, and it is a pie that Saudi Arabia is keen on capturing. China is the world’s largest crude oil importer, and the Saudis have come up trumps as China’s top supplier of the commodity in April despite Russia’s cheap sanctioned oil. \"\"\""
